# 🤖 AI Recruitment Screening Bot  
### *AI-powered résumé screening using Python + OpenAI*

The AI Recruitment Screening Bot is a lightweight Python tool that evaluates a candidate’s résumé against a job description. It uses an LLM (OpenAI GPT model) to generate a structured, bias-aware assessment including:

- Match score (0–100)  
- Summary of candidate fit  
- Key strengths  
- Skill gaps  
- Hiring recommendation  

This project bridges my **HR background** with my growing skills in **Python, automation, and AI**, demonstrating how technology can improve hiring workflows.
