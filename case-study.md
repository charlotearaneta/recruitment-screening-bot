# 🤖 AI Recruitment Screening Bot  
## Case Study  

AI Recruitment Screening Bot is a Python-based HR-Tech project that applies AI to automate first-round résumé screening. The tool evaluates a candidate’s résumé against a job description using a Large Language Model (OpenAI) and produces structured, unbiased insights—including match scores, strengths, gaps, and hiring recommendations.

This project was developed as part of my transition from **Human Resources to technology**, combining my HR domain knowledge with newly acquired skills in **Python, automation, and AI**. It demonstrates how AI can augment recruitment workflows by handling repetitive screening tasks while preserving human judgment in final hiring decisions.

## 1. Executive Summary

The **AI Recruitment Screening Bot** is a Python-based HR-Tech solution designed to automate and standardize first-round résumé screening. Using a Large Language Model (OpenAI), the tool evaluates a candidate’s résumé against a job description and generates structured, bias-aware insights including match scores, strengths, gaps, and hiring recommendations.

## 2. Problem Statement

During my years in recruitment and HR, I consistently saw these issues:

- Recruiters manually skim hundreds of résumés, increasing fatigue and errors.  
- Matching skills to job descriptions can be subjective and inconsistent.  
- Early-stage screening often misses good candidates due to time pressure.  
- Small teams or startups lack structured screening processes.  
- Recruiters do not always have technical knowledge for IT roles.  

I wanted to create a tool that:

- **automates the first-level screening**,  
- provides **objective, structured evaluation**,  
- and reduces the recruiter’s workload.
  
For small teams and growing organizations, these challenges can delay hiring and reduce the quality of candidate shortlisting.

There is a clear need for a **lightweight, automated screening tool** that improves efficiency and consistency without replacing human decision-making.

This project bridges **HR expertise** + **AI technology** to create a productivity tool that’s simple yet powerful.

## Who It Helps  

### This bot is helpful for:

- **Recruiters** doing high-volume screening  
- **HR assistants** who are new to technical roles  
- **Small businesses** without an HR team  
- **Job seekers** wanting to evaluate their own résumés  
- **Students** learning how job descriptions match skill profiles  

Ultimately, it increases efficiency, reduces bias, and provides a consistent evaluation framework.

## 3. Objective

The objective of the AI Recruitment Screening Bot is to:

- Automate first-round résumé screening  
- Provide structured and objective candidate evaluations  
- Reduce manual workload for recruiters  
- Improve consistency in candidate assessment  
- Serve as a foundation for more advanced HR-Tech systems  

The tool is designed to **support recruiters**, not replace them, by providing clear insights that inform hiring decisions.

---

## 4. Solution Overview

The AI Recruitment Screening Bot evaluates a single résumé against a job description and produces a structured assessment that includes:

- Match score (0–100)  
- Summary of candidate fit  
- Key strengths  
- Skill or experience gaps  
- Hiring recommendation  

By leveraging Python and OpenAI models, the tool converts unstructured résumé data into actionable recruitment insights. The output format is consistent and recruiter-friendly, making it easy to interpret and compare candidates.

## 5. Technical Approach

### a. Input Handling  
The script reads two input files:
- A job description (`job_description.txt`)
- A candidate résumé (`candidate_resume.txt`)

### b. AI Evaluation Logic  
A carefully designed prompt instructs the AI model to act as an experienced recruiter and return results in a structured JSON format. The prompt emphasizes role alignment, skills, and experience while avoiding sensitive demographic assumptions.

### c. Output Generation  
The AI returns a structured response containing:
- Match score  
- Summary  
- Strengths  
- Gaps  
- Recommendation  

Results are displayed in a clear, JSON-style format for easy review and potential integration into larger HR workflows.

## 6. Impact and Results

The AI Recruitment Screening Bot delivers meaningful improvements to the recruitment process:

- **Increased efficiency:** Reduces résumé screening time from minutes per résumé to seconds  
- **Improved consistency:** Ensures every candidate is evaluated using the same criteria  
- **Reduced bias risk:** Encourages objective, role-focused assessments  
- **Scalability:** Serves as a building block for batch screening and applicant tracking systems  

The project demonstrates how even a simple automation can significantly enhance HR productivity.

## 7. Key Learnings

Building this project taught me:

### ✔ How HR logic translates into technical workflows  
Recruitment criteria must be clearly defined to produce reliable AI outputs.

### ✔ The importance of prompt engineering  
Well-structured prompts are critical for consistent, unbiased evaluations.

### ✔ How automation supports—not replaces—human judgment  
AI is most effective when used to augment decision-making rather than automate final outcomes.

### ✔ How small tools can enable scalable HR-Tech solutions  
This project laid the groundwork for more advanced systems such as an Automated Applicant Tracker.

### Building an end-to-end automation tool deepened my confidence in:
- Python scripting
- API usage
- Input/output design
- Testing and debugging
- AI-supported decision making
